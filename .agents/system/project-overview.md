# Project Overview

This project is a modern Serverless AWS analytics backend using:

- **DynamoDB** for storing application data (events, features, users, cohorts, notes)
- **Clickhouse DB** for storing and querying analytics data
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless functions
- **API Gateway** for exposing RESTful APIs
- **TypeScript** for type safety with ES modules
- **Zod** for schema validation
- **Middy** for Lambda middleware
- **AWS Cognito** for user authentication and authorization
- **KMS** for encryption/decryption operations

Follow these conventions for human and AI contributors. Only use approved dependencies.
