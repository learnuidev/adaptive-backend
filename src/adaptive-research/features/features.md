# Features

Features in adaptive allows you to manage entire lifecycle of the feature.

This includes:

- Creating a feature
- Manging feature versions
- Managing how a feature is released (via a feature called feature release)
- Conducting A/B tests for a feature versions
- Monitoring the performance of a feature version
- Rolling back a feature version
- Disabling a feature version
